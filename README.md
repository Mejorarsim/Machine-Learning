# Protein Secondary Structure Prediction

## Aim
This project aims to leverage deep learning techniques to predict protein secondary structures from amino acid sequences and PSSMs.

## Methodology

- Imported libraries such as numpy, pandas, and PyTorch for data manipulation and model building.
- Mapped amino acids to integers for machine learning processing.

- Developed a `ProteinDataset` class for efficient data handling.
- Utilized padding and DataLoader for batch processing.

- Designed and trained a neural network with embedding and convolutional layers.
- Monitored training progress through loss visualization.

- Evaluated the model on a test dataset and calculated accuracy.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 75.97% on the test set, suggesting potential areas for refinement and further development.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates the application of deep learning to computational biology, with initial results showing promise and indicating future directions for enhancing model performance.

I enjoyed working on this project and exploring the intersection of deep learning and bioinformatics. The experience has been enriching, and I look forward to improving the model and sharing updates.
